  A quick and simple project, but a fun and creative one! Required using the DOM to input my text and pictures. A better solution than displaying it from the HTML. Had to approach it from different solutions which took some time, but it was rewarding.

## How Its Made 

**Languages used:** Html, CSS, Javascript

# What I Learned

I learned the use between `innerText` and `innerHTML` and how to apply them. I researched the different DOM properties and used the style property for this project. In my first draft, I used `switch statements`, but in the end I "switched" to IF and ELSE IF statements!
